5. **Prediction**: Forecasts future CO2 emissions for the next 10 years
6. **Reporting**: Generates a comprehensive analysis report

## Output Files

The analyzer generates several output files:

- `co2_trends_analysis.png` - Multi-panel chart showing historical trends
- `co2_predictions.png` - Chart with historical data and future predictions
- `co2_analysis_report.txt` - Detailed text report with findings and recommendations

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- **CO2 Per Capita**: Metric tons per person
- **Total CO2 Emissions**: Kilotons annually
- **Growth Rates**: Year-over-year percentage changes
- **Moving Averages**: Smoothed trend lines
- **Future Projections**: 10-year forecasts

## Models Used

1. **Linear Regression**: For trend-based predictions
2. **Random Forest**: For complex pattern recognition
3. **Model Selection**: Automatically chooses best performing model based on RÂ² score

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computations
- matplotlib/seaborn: Data visualization
- scikit-learn: Machine learning models
- requests: API data fetching
- statsmodels: Statistical analysis

### Data Processing
- Handles missing data points
- Calculates derived metrics (growth rates, moving averages)
- Validates data quality and consistency
- Provides fallback sample data if API fails

## Sample Analysis Results

The analyzer provides insights such as:
- Average CO2 per capita trends over time
- Peak emission years and values
- Annual growth rate patterns
- Future emission projections
- Policy recommendations

## Customization

You can modify the analyzer by:
- Changing the prediction timeframe (default: 10 years)
- Adding new visualization types
